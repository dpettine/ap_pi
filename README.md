PI basic access point and WiFi configuration function
This project implements a basic Rapberry PI WiFi Access Point to allow users to immeadeatly and easily access the device for the initial WiFi configuration.
After plugging in the PI to a power source and the initial startup the device will start in Acess Point mode advertising it's own network.
The user will be able to connect his computer, tablet or smartphone to the advertised wifi.
By simply opening a browser on the handle and connecting to the local configurable PI http address (IE http://raspberrypi.local/8080) a responsive web page wil be shown to configure the WiFi the PI device has to connect to.
The purpose of this project is to provide a easy method to deploy Raspberry PI IOT appliactions to a real production audience.
